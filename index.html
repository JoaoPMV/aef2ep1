          My <input id="myName" type="text"> is Jenny Zelinski. I live and work in New York.
          I'm the assistent editor of a magazine called NewYork24Seven. A few <input id="months" type="text"> ago, I
          <input id="visited" type="text"> our office in London to
          learn more about the company. I met the manager, Daniel O'Conner. I had lots of
          <input id="meetings" type="text"> with him, of course. And a working dinner on my
          birthday. But I spent more time with Rob Walker. He's one of the <input id="writers" type="text"> on the
          London magazine. We had coffees together. We
          went <input id="sightseeing" type="text">. I even helped Rob buy a t-shirt! He was fun to be with. I liked him
          a lot.
          I think he liked me, too. Rob isn't the most <input id="punctual" type="text"> person in
          the world, but he's a great writer. We invited him to work for the New York magazine for
          a month, and he agreed. So now Rob's <input id="coming" type="text"> to New York. I know
          he's really excited about it. It's going to be great to see him again.

          Do you have a good <input id="view" type="text"> from your room? I can see lots of

          Yes, I am a bit. What time is it now? It's nine o'clock. Nine o'clock?
          That's two o'clock in the morning for me. Let's <input id="finish" type="text"> our
          drinks. You need to go to bed. I guess you're right. So, I'll see you in the office

          Thanks, Jenny. There's <input id="just" type="text">one thing. What's that? Don't be

          Well, I think that's <input id="everything" type="text">. What do you think of the office?
          It's brilliant. And much <input id="bigger" type="text"> than our place in London.
          Oh, here's Barbara. Rob, this is Barbara, the editor of the magazine. It's good to
          <input id="finally" type="text"> meet you, Rob. It's great to be here. Is this your first time

          this time? Barbara, I'm going to take Rob for lunch. <input id="would" type="text"> you like to

          The tuna

          things like that. Are you planning to do any interviews? I'd like to.
          Do you have any <input id="suggestions" type="text">? Well, I know
          some great musicians. Musicians? You know, guys in a band. And I also have some contacts
          in the <input id="theater" type="text"> and dance. That would be great. Maybe we could go to a
          show, and after you could talk to the actors. I really like that idea. Can I <input id="bring" type="text">
          you anything else? Could we have the check, please? Yes, ma'am. Here's your check.
          Thanks. Excuse me. I think there's a mistake. We had two <input id="bottles" type="text"> of
          water, not three. You're right. I'm really sorry. It's not my day today. I'll get you a new check. Thank you.
          We're going to <input id="have" type="text">a fun month, Rob. Yes. I think it's going to be
          fantastic. OK. Time to go. You have your meeting with Barbara at <input id="three" type="text">.

          Hey, Rob. Come on. Keep up. Sorry. I'm a <input id="bit" type="text"> tired this morning.
          You aren't <input id="exactly" type="text"> in good shape, are you? I know, I know. I think
          I'm <input id="eating" type="text"> too much. Then eat less. It isn't easy. I eat out all the

          Do you do anything to keep fit? I <input id="cycle" type="text"> when I'm in London. So
          why don't you get a bike <input id="here" type="text">? I'm only here for another three weeks.

          Yeah, I'm not very <input id="keen" type="text"> on running. So why don't play basketball with

          Sure. Can I help you? Yes. I bought these about half an hour ago. Yes, I <input id="remember" type="text">. Is
          there a problem? Yes. I'm <input id="afraid" type="text"> they're too small.
          What size are they? They're an eight. But I take a UK eight. Oh, right. Yes, a UK eight is a

          You see, I <input id="broke" type="text"> up with my girlfriend a few months before I met you.

          That was a good day's work, Rob. You did a great <input id="interview" type="text">.
          You took some great photos, too. <input id="theyre" type="text"> really nice. Thanks. Hey,
          let's have <input id="another" type="text"> coffee. I don't know. I have to
          get to Manhattan. You don't have to go right now. I'm not sure. I don't want to be late.
          Why do you have to go to Manhattan? I've got a... A date? You have a date? Mm-hmm.
          Is it with <input id="anybody" type="text"> I know? No, it isn't. Anyway, excuse me a minute.
          I need to go to the <input id="restroom" type="text">. That's very American. I'll order more
          coffees. Okay. Rob? Is that you, Jennifer? Oh. Hi, Holly. Is Rob there? Yeah. One second.
          Rob? Not anybody I know, huh? Hi, Jenny. Rob, are you <input id="still" type="text"> in
          Brooklyn? Yeah. You know the reservation at the restaurant's for eight, right? Don't
          <input id="worry" type="text">. I'll be there. Oh, how do I get to Greenwich Village on the
          <input id="subway" type="text">?

          How do I get to Greenwich Village on the subway? Go to the subway <input id="station" type="text"> at Prospect
          Park. Take the B train to West 4th Street. How many
          <input id="stops" type="text"> is that? Six or seven. Okay, and <input id="then" type="text"> ?
          From West 4th Street take the A train and get <input id="off" type="text"> at 14th Street.
          <input id="could" type="text"> you say that again? Okay. From Prospect Park take the B train
          to West 4th Street and then take the A train to 14th Street. That's <input id="only" type="text"> one stop.
          Where's the restaurant? Come out of the subway on 8th Avenue. Go <input id="straight" type="text"> on for
          about 50 yards and take the first left. That's Greenwich
          Avenue. The restaurant's on the right. It's <input id="called" type="text"> the Tea Set.
          Okay, thanks. See you later and don't <input id="get" type="text"> lost.

          Jenny. I'm here. Hi. I'm so sorry. There was a problem on the <input id="underground" type="text">. We call it
          the subway here, right? Anyway, the train <input id="stopped" type="text"> for about 20 minutes.
          I <input id="tried" type="text"> to call but there was no signal. I've been here since seven
          forty five. I know I <input id="ran" type="text"> from the underground Subway station. I'm so
          sorry. You're always late. It's funny, isn't it? I said, I'm sorry. Look, why don't
          we go back
          <input id="inside" type="text"> the restaurant? I waited for an hour for you. I don't want to
          stay here anymore. Maybe we could. We could go for a walk. We could <input id="find" type="text">
          another restaurant. I don't feel like I walk. It's been a long day. Okay, but the night is
          still <input id="young" type="text">. Maybe you have time to meet up with Holly again. Holly. I'm sorry. I
          didn't mean
          to say that. I don't care about Holly. Forget it Rob. Now if you don't mind, I'd like to go home. Listen to
          me. Jenny Holly is just a colleague. I <input id="said" type="text">
          forget it. It's okay. No, it isn't okay. Look, I know I'm always late and I know the
          underground is the subway, but that's not the point. I'm not interested in Holly. I came to New
          York because of you. The only person I'm <input id="interested" type="text"> in is you.

          I can't believe it. Your month here is nearly over. It's gone so fast. I know. I've had a

          Yes. And I'm

          interview in New York. I don't want to be late. Okay. See you later, then. Bye. Jenny, is
