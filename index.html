          My <input id="myName" type="text"> is Jenny Zelinski. I live and work in New York.
          I'm the assistent editor of a magazine called NewYork24Seven. A few <input id="months" type="text"> ago, I
          <input id="visited" type="text"> our office in London to
          learn more about the company. I met the manager, Daniel O'Conner. I had lots of
          <input id="meetings" type="text"> with him, of course. And a working dinner on my
          birthday. But I spent more time with Rob Walker. He's one of the <input id="writers" type="text"> on the
          London magazine. We had coffees together. We
          went <input id="sightseeing" type="text">. I even helped Rob buy a t-shirt! He was fun to be with. I liked him
          a lot.
          I think he liked me, too. Rob isn't the most <input id="punctual" type="text"> person in
          the world, but he's a great writer. We invited him to work for the New York magazine for
          a month, and he agreed. So now Rob's <input id="coming" type="text"> to New York. I know
          he's really excited about it. It's going to be great to see him again.

          Yes, I am a bit. What time is it now? It's nine o'clock. Nine o'clock?
          That's two o'clock in the morning for me. Let's <input id="finish" type="text"> our
          drinks. You need to go to bed. I guess you're right. So, I'll see you in the office
          at eleven in the morning. At eleven? Is <input id="that" type="text"> OK? It's perfect.
          Thanks, Jenny. There's <input id="just" type="text">one thing. What's that? Don't be

          Well, I think that's everything. What do you think of the office? It's brilliant. And
          much bigger than our place in London. Oh, here's Barbara. Rob, this is Barbara, the
          editor of the magazine. It's good to finally meet you, Rob. It's great to be here.
          Is this your first time in New York? No, I came here when I was eighteen. But only
          for a few days. Well, I hope you get to know New York much better this time? Barbara, I'm
          going to take Rob for lunch. Would you like to come with us? I'd love to, but unfortunately
          I have a meeting at one. So, I'll see you later. We're meeting at three, I think. That's right.
          Have a nice lunch. Hey, are you Rob Walker? Yes.

          Would you like that with fries or a baked potate? Fries, please. How would you like your
          steak? Rare, medium or well done? Well done. Nothing for me. Ok. And to drink? Water,
          please. Still or sparkling? Sparkling. The tuna for you, ma'am, and the steak for you,
          sir. I'm sorry, but I asked for a green salad, not fries. No problem, I'll change it.
          Excuse me. Yes, sir? Sorry, I asked for my steak well done and this is rare. I'm really
          sorry. I'll take it back to the kitchen.

          So tell me, Rob. What are you going to write about? Well, to start with, my first
          impressions of New York. You know, the nightlife, the music, things like that. Are you
          planning to do any interviews? I'd like to. Do you have any suggestions? Well, I know
          some great musicians. Musicians? You know, guys in a band. And I also have some contacts
          in the theater and dance. That would be great. Maybe we could go to a show, and after
          you could talk to the actors. I really like that idea. Can I bring you anything else?
          Could we have the check, please? Yes, ma'am. Here's your check. Thanks. Excuse me. I
          think there's a mistake. We had two bottles of water, not three. You're right. I'm really
          sorry. It's not my day today. I'll get you a new check. Thank you. We're going to have
          a fun month, Rob. Yes. I think it's going to be fantastic. OK. Time to go. You have your
          meeting with Barbara at three. Oh, yeah. Right.

          Hey, Rob. Come on. Keep up. Sorry. I'm a bit tired this morning. You aren't exactly
          in good shape, are you? I know, I know. I think I'm eating too much. Then eat less.
          It isn't easy. I eat out all the time. And the portions in American restaurants
          are enormous. You don't do enough exercise. I walk a lot. Walking isn't enough, Rob.
          Do you do anything to keep fit? I cycle when I'm in London. So why don't you get a bike
          here? I'm only here for another three weeks. Anyway, my hotel's near the office. I don't
          need a bike. You know. Jennifer goes running all the time. Before and after work. But I
          just think that running is just so boring. I mean, where's the fun? Yeah, I'm not very
          keen on running. So why don't play basketball with me and my friends? OK. That's a great idea.
          But I don't have any trainers. Trainers? Sneakers. You can buy some. Is there a sports shop
          near here? Sure. There's one across the street.

          Here you are. These are an eight. Do you want to try them on? No, thanks. I'm sure
          they'll be fine. How much are they? They're $83,94. Oh, it says $72,99. Yes, but there's
          an added sales tax of 15%. Oh, OK. Do you take Mastercard? Sure. Can I help you? Yes.
          I bought these about half an hour ago. Yes, I remember. Is there a problem? Yes. I'm
          afraid they're too small. What size are they? They're an eight. But I take a UK eight.
          Oh, right. Yes, a UK eight is a US nine. Do you have a pair? I'll go and check. Just
          a minute. I'm sorry, but we don't have these in a nine. But we have these and they're
          the same price. Or you can have a refund. Uh, I'll take this pair then, please. No
          problem. Do you have the recipt? Yes, here you are. Brilliant.

          Hi, Jenny. Oh, hi. Have you had a good day? Oh, you know. Meetings. What about you?
          It was great. I went to Brooklyn and met some really interesting people. And you had
          time to go shopping, too. What? Oh, yeah. I've just bought these. What are they?
          A pair of trainers. Uh, sneakers. Nice. Why did you buy sneakers? I think I need to get
          a bit fitter. Oh, I'm impressed. You know, I go running every morning in Central Park.
          Do you? It's so beautiful early in the morning. Why don't you come with me? Uh, sure.
          Why not? Great. I'll come by your hotel tomorrow morning. Oh. What time? Six forty-five?
          Six? Forty-five. Six? Forty-five. Can we make a bit later Say, seven forty-five?
          That's too late, Rob. Let's make it seven fifteen. OK. Excellent. See you later. Great.
          Basketball and running, Rob. You must have a lot of energy. Uh, yeah.

          work? I could make you something a little healthier. I'd really like that. Thanks. So,
          how do you feel now? Are you ready to go again? Oh yes. I'm ready for anything. Are

          You know, your offer to work here came at a very good time for me. Really? Yeah. I was
          looking for something new. Something different. You see, I broke up with my girlfriend
          a few months before I met you. Oh, right. What about you? What about me? You know,
          relationships? Oh, I've been to busy recently to think about relationships. Getting this
          job at the magazine was a really big thing for me. I guess that's taken up all my time
          and energy. But that isn't very good for you. Only thinking about working, I mean. Why
          didn't you tell me you weren't feeling well this morning? We didn't have to go for a run.
          I wanted to go. It was nice. Well, I'm glad you're feeling better. Would you like another
          coffee? No, thanks. I think I should get back to the hotel now. I've got a really busy
          day tomorrow. Do you have a telephone number for a taxi? Yeah, but I's much better to get
          a cab on the street. Oh, OK, then. I'll see you in the morning, if you're feeling OK. Oh,
          I'm sure I'll be fine. Thanks again for a great evening. Any time. Good night. Night, Rob.

          again? Okay. From Prospect Park take the B train to West 4th Street and then take the A
          train to 14th Street. That's only one stop. Where's the restaurant? Come out of the subway
          on 8th Avenue. Go straight on for about 50 yards and take the first left. That's Greenwich
          Avenue. The restaurant's on the right. It's called the Tea Set. Okay, thanks. See you later

          Jenny. I'm here. Hi. I'm so sorry. There was a problem on the underground. We call it
          the subway here, right? Anyway, the train stopped for about 20 minutes. I tried to call
          but there was no signal. I've been here since 745. I know I ran from the underground
          Subway station. I'm so sorry. You're always late. It's funny, isn't it? I said, I'm sorry.
          Look, why don't we go back inside the restaurant? I waited for an hour for you. I don't
          want to stay here anymore. Maybe we could. We could go for a walk. We could find another
          restaurant. I don't feel like a walk. It's been a long day. Okay, but the night is still
          young. Maybe you have time to meet up with Holly again. Holly. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
          say that. I don't care about Holly forget it Rob. Now if you don't mind, I'd like to go
          home. Listen to me. Jenny Holly is just a colleague. I said forget it. It's okay. No, it
          isn't okay. Look, I know I'm always late and I know the underground is the subway, but
          that's not the point. I'm not interested in Holly. I came to New York because of you.
          The only person I'm interested in is you.

          I can't believe it.
          Your month here is nearly over. It's gone so fast. I know. I've had a great time, Jenny.
          Me too. It's been really special. But... But what? Well, it won't be the same when you're
          in London and I'm here. But we'll still be in touch. You can visit me in London and I can
          come back here to see you. It still won't be the same. No. No, it won't. Maybe I could
          come back to London with you. You can't do that, Jenny. You just got this job. That's true.
          Well, we still have some time together. We're going out for dinner tonight. Yes. And I'm
          going to take you somewhere really nice. Look at the time. I have to go now. It's my last
          interview in New York. I don't want to be late. Okay. See you later, then. Bye. Jenny, is
          Rob here? Oh, you just missed him, Barbara. I really need to talk to him. I'll try him on
          his cell phone. Hello, Rob. It's Barbara. Can you give me a call? There's something I'd
          like to talk about.

          Jenny! Rob, I have something to tell you. I have something to tell you too. You go first.
          Well, I thought again about moving to London. But you don't need to move to London.
          What? Barbara called me earlier. What about? She offered me a job. Here, in New York.
          What? Oh, that's great news. You don't seem very pleased. I am. I mean, it's great. It's just
          that... What? I sent Barbara an email this morning. And? I told her I was quitting and moving to
          London. Don't worry. Maybe she hasn't read your email yet. I'll call her. Hello, Barbara Keaton.
          Barbara, it's Jenny. Oh, hi Jenny. Um, have you read your emails recently? There's one from me.
          Oh, yes. I can see it. I haven't opened it yet. Don't open it. Delete it. Please, just delete it.
          I'll explain later. Okay. It's gone. Is everything alright, Jenny? Yes, thanks. Never better.
