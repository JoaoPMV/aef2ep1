          My <input id="myName" type="text"> is Jenny Zelinski. I live and work in New York.
          I'm the assistent editor of a magazine called NewYork24Seven. A few <input id="months" type="text"> ago, I
          <input id="visited" type="text"> our office in London to
          learn more about the company. I met the manager, Daniel O'Conner. I had lots of
          <input id="meetings" type="text"> with him, of course. And a working dinner on my
          birthday. But I spent more time with Rob Walker. He's one of the <input id="writers" type="text"> on the
          London magazine. We had coffees together. We
          went <input id="sightseeing" type="text">. I even helped Rob buy a t-shirt! He was fun to be with. I liked him
          a lot.
          I think he liked me, too. Rob isn't the most <input id="punctual" type="text"> person in
          the world, but he's a great writer. We invited him to work for the New York magazine for
          a month, and he agreed. So now Rob's <input id="coming" type="text"> to New York. I know
          he's really excited about it. It's going to be great to see him again.

          There's a problem with the air-conditioning. It isn't working, and it's very hot in my

          Yeah, it's <input id="great" type="text"> to be here. It's <input id="really" type="text"> exciting. And how's
          your hotel? It's fine. My room is really nice.
          Do you have a good <input id="view" type="text"> from your room? I can see lots of
          buildings. Tomorrow I'm going to show you around the office and <input id="introduce" type="text"> you to the

          Barbara, my boss? Oh, yeah, sorry. And then you can <input id="start" type="text">
          thinking about your blog and the column. Have you got any <input id="ideas" type="text">
          yet, Rob? Rob? What? Sorry, Jenny. You must be really <input id="tired" type="text">.
          Yes, I am a bit. What time is it now? It's nine o'clock. Nine o'clock?
          That's two o'clock in the morning for me. Let's <input id="finish" type="text"> our
          drinks. You need to go to bed. I guess you're right. So, I'll see you in the office
          at eleven in the morning. At eleven? Is <input id="that" type="text"> OK? It's perfect.
          Thanks, Jenny. There's <input id="just" type="text">one thing. What's that? Don't be
          late. By the way, it's great to see you <input id="again" type="text">.
